<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><big>T</big>o court applause by oblique dexterity, or without
a due sense of respect for public opinion, impertinently
to advance pretensions, is equally revolting to
the feelings of an ingenuous mind. But as genius
and a desire of fame are naturally allied, and, perhaps,
the former never existed without the latter;
will not the youthful adventurer be justified in endeavouring
to stand well in the opinion of the judicious
and discerning, by disseminating his works
among them&mdash;under a confidence, that the more
candid will be pleased with the first blossoms of
poetical talent, not only as the fruits of industry, but
as presages in maturer years of more elevated titles
to distinction? With these impressions, the Author
of the following Poems has been induced, by the
advice of his friends, to offer the present Collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
to the public. The praise of friends, I am aware, is
not always a sufficient reason for publication;&mdash;and
pieces of poetry, dictated by some local occurrence,
or intended as a tribute of politeness or affection to
some individual, though at first much admired, may,
nevertheless scarcely deserve to be transmitted to
posterity. I am well aware that the strict eye of
criticism may discover imperfections, and that a nice
ear may, perhaps, occasionally be hurt by a harsh
line;&mdash;and, that some, from a dread of inspiring into
a young mind, a taste for extra-academical fame, may
be disposed to extinguish altogether such attempts&mdash;yet
it would be straining delicacy beyond convenient
bounds, if we did not cherish the idea, that there may
be others, who may be pleased to look propitiously
on the first specimens of genius at so early an age&mdash;many
of them having been written when the Author
had attained only his Thirteenth year, and the whole
before he had completed Fifteen years of age. Their
claims are not, <i>perhaps</i>, of that superior kind, which
will find a place among the first orders of poetry;
but the pieces breathe throughout the true spirit of
virtuous sensibility, vigour of fancy, and that characteristic
manner, which always accompanies strong
power of invention;&mdash;they display richness of imagery,
and elegance of style, while the language has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
easy flow, and unaffected simplicity, free from that
artificial splendor, and obscure magnificence, which
modern taste seems to establish as the excellence of
poetical diction. Most of the larger Poems in the
Collection express in easy language, and at the same
time with all the graces of genuine poetry, every sentiment
fitted to the occasion on which they were
written. Of this, among the lighter ones, the reader
will have an agreeable specimen in the verses dedicated
to Lady C . . . . . L&mdash;&mdash;, which though on a trivial subject,
may, perhaps, give as just and pleasing an idea of
this Writer’s poetical talents, as any other single piece
among the more trifling ones which we can collect.
The Translations of the first Chorus of Œdipus Tyrrannus,
and two Odes of Horace, exhibit no small degree
of classical attainment: and, however just or otherwise
the remark may be, “that the failure of preceding
translators has arisen, in a great measure,
from a desire to copy the variations of Horace’s
measures;” the present ones convey a correct and
spirited explanation of the sense in general, and by
observing circumstances and the little figures and
turns on the words, (that <i>curiosa felicitas verborum</i>,)
they have preserved the beauties, and kept alive that
spirit and fire, which make the chief character of the
original.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span></p>

<p>It will not, therefore, be presuming too much, to
hope that these Poems may contain enough to draw
from such as value the display of early talents, a
favourable reception; and that the Author, under
such encouragement, when his taste is more matured,
will perfect the produce of his youthful industry,
and by diligence add to the stores of a mind formed
by nature to accumulate and decorate them&mdash;there is
only left for me to say,</p>

<h2><a name="ADVERTISEMENT" id="ADVERTISEMENT"></a>ADVERTISEMENT<br /><br />
BY THE AUTHOR.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> my friend has said so much and
so flattering to myself, in his Preface, yet the diffidence
and the anxiety which ever accompany a first
attempt, particularly at so early an age, urge me to
add a few words, however superfluous they may
appear. An apology is indeed, perhaps, always
requisite for an intrusion on the public, and I cannot,
therefore, refrain from offering one for some of the
Poems which are inferior to the rest. They were
written when but a child&mdash;they were the first faint
dawnings of poetic enthusiasm,&mdash;and that sense of
integrity, which should accompany every action,
prevented my now altering them, in any <i>material</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span>
respect. I expressly state the age at which they were
written, and I think it but a duty to the public, that
they should actually be written at that age. For the
same reason, therefore, and not from any arrogant
vanity, I have been particularly careful that no other
hand should have polished, or improved them.</p>

<p>For the Battle of Waterloo, much ought to be said
in apology, when so many far, far more adequate to
the task, than myself, have written upon it; and when
so many have failed in the attempt, it seems to argue
vanity in the design; but such, I may assert, was far
from my mind, at the time of its composition. It
was begun in a moment of enthusiasm&mdash;it was continued
from a deep interest in the undertaking&mdash;and
it was completed from a dislike, I have always entertained,
to leave any thing unfinished. But I was
myself very unwilling to commit it to the press, and
only did so at the express and flattering desire of
some intimate friends, who were, perhaps, too partial
to perceive its defects.</p>

<p>To the generosity of the more lenient of the public,
do I now confide this first attempt for their favour;
and, as they scan over the faults with the eye of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
Criticism, may the hand of Mercy restrain them from
dragging those faults to light.</p>

<p>The solicitude that I feel, would induce me to
indulge in a tedious prolixity; but I must remember,
that none but <i>myself</i> can be interested in my <i>own</i>
feelings, and I will, therefore, no longer detain my
readers from the proof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span></p>

<p class="cded">
TO WHOM SHOULD A YOUNG, AND TIMID<br />
COMPETITOR FOR PUBLIC REPUTATION,<br />
DEDICATE HIS ATTEMPTS,<br />
BUT TO<br />
A BRITISH PUBLIC?<br />
TO THAT PUBLIC, WHO HAVE ALWAYS<br />
BEEN THE FOSTERERS OF INDUSTRY, OR GENIUS,<br />
WHO HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD FROM<br />
THE IMPERFECTIONS OF YOUTH,<br />
TO THE<br />
FRUITS OF MATURITY.<br />
IT IS TO THAT GENEROUS PUBLIC,<br />
THAT HE NOW COMMITS HIS HOPES AND HIS FEARS.<br />
IT IS TO THAT GENEROUS PUBLIC,<br />
THAT HE NOW OFFERS HIS<br />
JUVENILE EFFORTS,<br />
FOR THEIR APPLAUSE!<br />

ON CANTO I.</h2>

<h3>Stanza I.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Spread Ismael’s banners to the wanton breeze.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>For the better understanding of several passages in
this Poem, I will here subjoin a short account of the
claims of my hero, Ismael, to the throne of Persia,
and a brief history of his life.</p>

<p>Usum Cassan, king of Persia, gave his daughter,
Martha, in marriage to Shich-Eidar, a certain sage,
famous for a new sect of religion, and for extraordinary
piety and virtue.</p>

<p>At Usum Cassan’s death, he was succeeded by his
son Jacup, but he being murdered by his wife, Julaver,
a man of high rank, and a distant relation to him,
seized the throne, and dying, after three years, was
succeeded by Baysinger, and at his death, the crown
came to a young nobleman named Rustam.</p>

<p>Though no one had a better (nor indeed so good
a) right to the kingdom of Persia as Shich-Eidar, on
account of his marriage with Usum Cassan’s daughter,
yet his birth being inferior to those who had hitherto
reigned, and being so entirely absorbed in the care of
religion, and the sweets of retirement; during the
sway of the three preceding kings, there was not
even any mention of him, or his pretensions. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span>
Rustam was alarmed at the numbers who daily flocked
to Shich-Eidar, to embrace his religious principles,
and he was afraid of the reverence which the Persians
paid to his high virtues and brilliant talents, and of
their secret attachment to the race of Usum Cassan;
he therefore resolved to rid himself of so formidable
an object for his fears, and employed assassins, who
murdered the unfortunate sage at his residence in
Ardevil. But Rustam was afterwards slain in his turn
by Achmet, who is said <i>to have been favoured by the
king’s own mother, and aided by her in the death of her
son</i>.</p>

<p>The murderer seized the crown, but enjoyed it only
six months, when Carabes, one of Rustam’s ancient
officers, collecting a considerable body of soldiers,
marched straight to Tauris, then the capital of Persia,
and surprising Achmet, who was in no condition to
resist, put him to death, by the most dreadful (though
almost merited) tortures.</p>

<p>The throne being thus vacant, Alvante, a nobleman
of high rank, was chosen to fill it.</p>

<p>Shich-Eidar left three sons, who would have shared
the same fate as their father, had they fallen into
Rustam’s hands. The two eldest fled, one to Asia
Minor, the other to Aleppo, and the third, Ismael,
then only a child, was secretly conveyed, by his
father’s friends, to Hyrcania or Ghilan; where he
was protected by Pyrchalim, a nobleman then in
possession of several places on the Caspian Sea.
Pyrchalim caused him to be reared in the religious
tenets of Shich-Eidar, and the youth perceiving that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span>
was the best way to acquire popular favour, of which
he had great need to support the just pretensions he
had to the throne, shewed a great zeal to observe,
and to propagate, his paternal sect. As he was possessed
of great personal beauty, and inherited all the
splendid abilities of his father, combined with great
courage and eloquence, he was soon joined, not only
by the common people, but also by many of high rank.</p>

<p>His first success in arms, was the regaining certain
lands in Armenia, which had been given his mother
as her dowry, and afterwards being reinforced by
many of Shich-Eidar’s old disciples, he attacked the
castle of Mamurlac, and after having taken and
plundered it, he led his victorious army to Sumach,
the capital of Mesopotamia, which he also took, and
gave the spoils to his soldiers. At the noise of these
first exploits, and at the immense booty acquired by
those who followed his standard, numbers daily flocked
to him from all parts, and he soon found himself at
the head of a considerable army, with which he resolved
to march immediately to Tauris, where Alvante,
lately placed upon the throne, held his court. That
monarch had but just recovered from the fatigues
and confusion of a civil war with Moratcham, his
brother (or, as some assert, his son), who disputed the
crown with him, and having lost an important battle,
had fled from the Persian territories.</p>

<p>The severe persecutions which Alvante had exercised,
after his victory, upon several of the chiefs of
Tauris, who had taken part with his opponent, rendered
his name odious, and presented Ismael with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span>
very fair opportunity, who no sooner came before the
city, than the gates were thrown open. Alvante, who
suspected nothing of this irruption into his capital,
without troops, and aware of the hatred entertained
against him by the whole city, was obliged to fly (and
as one author relates) in disguise: and Ismael entered
triumphantly into Tauris, without shedding the least
blood, except of a few of Alvante’s guards.</p>

<p>In the mean time Moratcham had reconciled himself
to his brother Alvante, for the purpose of repelling
their common enemy, the former hastened to Assyria
to raise forces, and the latter was already at the head
of a large army in Armenia: there Ismael followed
him, and (preventing Moratcham’s joining his brother,
which was their intention,) defeated him in a battle,
in which Alvante fell, bravely fighting at the head of
his troops. Moratcham, hearing of his brother’s fate,
carried his army towards Tauris, but Ismael intercepting
him, totally routed and put him to flight.</p>

<p>After this, Ismael reigned gloriously for twenty-five
years, and died in peaceable possession of one of the
most powerful monarchies in the world, having verified
the predictions of Shich-Eidar, who was a very
skilful astrologer, and who had foretold,&mdash;“That this
“son of his should one day by his zeal and conquests
“almost equal the glory of Mahomet himself.”</p>

<span class="i0">“<i>And she for safety from the civil war.</i>”<br /></span>

</div>

<p>It must be remembered that Ismael first attacked
Armenia, &amp;c. before his successes made him so bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span>
as to strike so adventurous a blow as attacking
Alvante in his own capital. It was the custom of
those who inhabited the provinces, and who were
too peaceably inclined to mix in the intestine commotions
that so often occur in the East, to remove their
families and effects as near the capital as possible,
though this scheme must appear very injudicious to
one who reflects that the chief city is generally the
most harrassed, ultimately.</p>

<p>The Süankos cannot properly be called a war
instrument, although in the earlier ages of Persia,
and even perhaps in Ismael’s time, it was made use
of for that purpose. It is at present often used as a
trumpet, for sounding an alarm, or a signal. Its tones
are deep and hollow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span></p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>ON CANTO I.</h3>

<p>As so many excellent works have been published,
giving a full and accurate account of the transactions
of the battle, and as they are so recent in the memory
of all who may honour this Poem with their perusal, I
shall be very brief and select in my Notes.</p>

<h4>Stanza III.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>These hardy troops</i> Napoléon’s brother <i>led</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Jerome Buonaparte.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>For the first time in arms confronting stand.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Duke of Wellington had won twenty-seven
battles over Napoléon’s generals, and was at last
personally confronted with their master. Napoléon
observed at Paris,&mdash;“that he was at last going to
“measure swords with this Wellington, of whom he
should certainly give a good account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span>”</p>

<h4>Stanza VI.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Where stood the pride of Caledonia’s force.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Scotch Greys.</p>

<h4>Stanza VII.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>And Scotia, aided by an English band.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Bays.</p>

<h4>Stanza XI.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>No modern field could ever yet behold</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<i>A fight so slaught’rous, and a war so bold.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This was perhaps the severest engagement of
cavalry ever fought on a modern field, and though
the Greys eventually conquered by miracles of valour,
they might well exclaim with Pyrrhus,&mdash;“Another
such victory would ruin us.”</p>

<h4>Stanza XII.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The gallant Byng.</i>”&mdash;General Byng.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>While Saltoun.</i>”&mdash;Lord Saltoun.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h4>Stanza XIII.</h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Th’ heroic Ponsonby.</i>”&mdash;Sir William Ponsonby.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As Sir William Ponsonby was gallopping after his
impetuous regiments, he had to cross a field lately
ploughed, and of a very soft soil, and being badly
mounted, his horse sunk in it. At that very moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span>
he perceived a troop of lancers coming at full speed,
and seeing all was over, took the picture of his wife
from his bosom, and was giving the melancholy token
to his aid-de-camp, to bear to his family, when the
lancers coming up, killed both of them. To make
the story more poetically affecting, I have taken the
almost unpardonable licence of altering the facts.</p>

<h4>Stanza XXI.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Melted to love before a brother’s name.</i>”<br /></span>

<p>Not so by the ties of love, but friendship.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>I have endeavoured throughout the whole of this
Poem, to observe a strict impartiality between the
British and French, and their commanders; not
following the practice of some, who seem scarcely
disposed to allow Buonaparte the character of a
general; but these should consider, that the braver
the troops, and the more experienced and skilful
their leader, so much more is the glory of conquering
them.</p>

is very different from that of the original; but it is my humble
opinion, that it is utterly impossible to imitate the Version, and,
at the same time, to preserve the spirit of the expression, and
dignity of the idea; and it is really surprising that so many men
of deep learning and judgment have attempted what was certain
of failure: even Francis, who has done Horace more justice than
any other translator, frequently, even in some of the sublimest
odes, degenerates to a mere ballad singer. Were we, indeed, to
make use of an irregular metre, it might, perhaps, be easy to
translate <i>the beauty</i>, as well as <i>the meaning</i>; but, of all regular
metres, I think our heroic is by far the best adapted for the
grander odes.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
